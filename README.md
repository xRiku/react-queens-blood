## How to play

## How to set up the project locally

In your terminal, run:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/xRiku/react-queens-blood.git
$ cd open-weather-forecast
$ npm i
```

Then you have to set up both the server and the application.

To set up the **application** you have to run

```sh
 $ npm run dev
```

To set up the **server** you just have to run

```sh
 $ npm run server
```

Now if you access `localhost:5173` and have done everything right you should be able to play the game.
